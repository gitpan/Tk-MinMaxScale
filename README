Tk/MinMaxScale version 0.12
===========================

Tk::MinMaxScale is a Frame-based widget wrapping two Scale widgets,
the first acting as a 'minimum' and the second as a 'maximum'.
Its purpose is to get a range of values narrower than the
whole range given by the options '-from' and '-to'.

$mms = $mw->MinMaxScale(
    -variablemin => \$vn,
    -variablemax => \$vx,
    -labelmin => ...,
    -labelmax => ...,
    ...,
);
